        <h1 class="ActionHeader">The Issue</h1>
            <p>When the economy starts to come back from a dramatic economic downturn, the total number of drug overdose deaths increases. The graph shows this possible correlation from 2006-2009. COVID-19 has caused a huge economic downturn and we are finally starting to bounce back slowly. This bounce back could cause an increase in the drug overdose deaths.</p>

        <h1 class="ActionHeader">During COVID-19</h1>
            <p>The social gathering restrictions put into place when COVID-19 first hit the country, caused the Federal government to relax their rules on prescribing methadone and buprenorphine. These two drugs are very effective in helping people who struggle with addition. They eased up on the rules to prescribe them because doctors couldn’t meet with patients in person. This caused a decrease in the drug overdose deaths because more people were using these medications to help get rid of their addiction.</p>

        <h1 class="ActionHeader">Possible Solution</h1>
            <p>-Inform the Public- By informing people about the epidemic, they will understand this is a bigger problem then what they previously had thought, spreading awareness of this issue.</p>
            <p>-Teletherapy- Taking with a doctor and making a plan over the phone, instead of in person.</p>
            <p>-Easing up the restrictions on prescribing methadone and buprenorphine so more people can get help with their addiction.</p>
            <p>These are just some possible solutions for helping people with a drug addiction during COVID-19. According to American Addiction Centres, 30% of people treatment are successful, the other 70% drop out before they complete the treatment. Even though the success rate is low, promoting treatment could have saved 30% of the people who died in 2018.</p>

        <p>Now, because we are bouncing back and people are starting to get their jobs back, they have more money to spend. When people lost their jobs, they didn’t have the money to go out and buy drugs, but now they have that money and can spend it on drugs. This may also cause an increase in the number of overdose deaths.</p>
